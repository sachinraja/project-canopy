# Project Canopy

Have you ever wanted to find out how much energy can be produced if solar canopies were installed on a given parking lot in LA? No? Well you need to re-evaluate your priorities.

## Methodology

This project uses data from the [LARIAC / LA County GIS Data Portal](https://data.lacounty.gov/datasets/413ba9befacf41a68f7dcad55a08f9a8) to get a list of parking lots in LA and their respective areas. We then use the [PVGIS](https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/) API to calculate the amount of energy that can be produced by solar panels installed on these parking lots.

## Why?

This information can be used to inform policy decisions, such as the incentives to provide,and to help decide whether it is beneficial to install solar canopies on parking lots at the individual and macro level.
